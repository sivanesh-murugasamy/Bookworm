                <p> Reading books offers numerous benefits, and these motivations can vary from person to person. Here are some common motivations for reading books:

                    Knowledge and Learning: Books are a rich source of information and knowledge. People read books to learn about various subjects, gain expertise in a specific area, or simply expand their understanding of the world.
                    
                    Escape and Entertainment: Books can transport readers to different worlds, times, and places. They offer a form of escapism, allowing readers to temporarily forget their own worries and immerse themselves in a story. </p>
